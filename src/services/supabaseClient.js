// user a signed token, and we hand that token to Supabase so the database
// knows who is making each request.

// --- Firebase as a trusted third-party auth provider for Supabase -------
//
// Previously every table's RLS policy was a permissive "soft gate"
// (`using (true)`) because Postgres had no way to verify who was really
// calling — the Firebase UID was just a plain value the client sent
// along with each query, which anyone could fake. That's no longer true
// once Firebase is configured as a trusted JWT issuer in this Supabase
// project (Dashboard -> Authentication -> Sign In / Providers -> Third
// Party Auth -> add your Firebase Project ID) — see
// supabase/migrations/022_question_versioning_and_rls.sql's header
// comment for the one-time setup step and why it's needed.
//
// Once that's configured, Supabase verifies the token's signature itself
// (against Firebase's public keys) before any RLS policy runs, so a
// policy that reads `auth.jwt() ->> 'sub'` can trust that value is the
// real, signed-in Firebase UID — not something the client can spoof.
// This `accessToken` callback is what hands that verified token to
// Supabase on every request; `getIdToken()` returns Firebase's cached
// token and silently refreshes it when it's close to expiring, so this
// is cheap to call on every request.



// Called by Supabase before every request to get the signed-in user's token.
function getFirebaseAccessToken() {
  const user = auth.currentUser;     // Nobody is signed in, so there is no token to send.
  if (!user) return Promise.resolve(null);

  // Firebase keeps the token cached and refreshes it before it expires,
  // so this is cheap to call. If it fails, we send no token rather than crash.
  return user.getIdToken().catch(() => null);

// supabaseUrl is your project's unique REST endpoint.
// supabaseAnonKey is the public "anon" key — safe to expose in the browser
// bundle (same idea as Firebase's apiKey), because it only grants whatever
// access your Row Level Security policies allow. NEVER put the
// "service_role" key in frontend code — that one bypasses RLS entirely.

// Create React App only exposes env vars prefixed with REACT_APP_ to the
// browser bundle, so both variables below must use that prefix, and must be
// set in a .env file at the project root (see .env.example).


// Connection details come from the .env file, never from the code itself.
// The URL is our project's address. The anon key is public by design and
// only allows what our Row Level Security rules allow. The powerful
// service_role key is never used in the browser.
